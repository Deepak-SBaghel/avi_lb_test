# VMware Avi Load Balancer Test Automation Framework Configuration
# This file contains all configuration required to run the test automation framework

# API Configuration
api:
  # Base URL of the mock Avi Load Balancer API
  # Note: This is the authenticated mock API server
  base_url: "https://semantic-brandea-banao-dc049ed0.koyeb.app/"
  
  # API request timeout in seconds
  timeout: 30

# User Credentials
# IMPORTANT: For security, consider using environment variables or secrets management
# in production environments instead of storing credentials in config files
credentials:
  # Username for registration and login
  username: "mytestuser123"
  
  # Password for registration and login
  password: "mypassword123"

# Target Virtual Service Configuration
target_virtual_service: "backend-vs-t1r_1000-1"

# Parallelism Configuration
# Controls how test cases are executed (sequential, threading, multiprocessing, asyncio)
parallelism:
  # Method: 'sequential', 'threading', 'multiprocessing', or 'asyncio'
  # 'sequential': Run test cases one after another
  # 'threading': Run test cases in parallel using threads (best for I/O-bound tasks)
  # 'multiprocessing': Run test cases in parallel using separate processes
  # 'asyncio': Run test cases asynchronously
  method: "threading"
  
  # Maximum number of parallel workers (for threading and multiprocessing)
  max_workers: 4

# Test Cases
# Define multiple test cases to be executed by the framework
test_cases:
  # Test Case 1: Main test to disable the target virtual service
  - name: "Test Case 1: Disable Backend VS T1R 1000-1"
    description: "Test disabling backend-vs-t1r_1000-1 virtual service"
    target_virtual_service: "backend-vs-t1r_1000-1"
    enabled: true
  
  #Test Case 2: Additional test case (demonstrates parallelism capability)
  - name: "Test Case 2: Disable Backend VS T1R 1000-2"
    description: "Test disabling another virtual service"
    target_virtual_service: "backend-vs-t1r_1000-2"
    enabled: true

# Logging Configuration
logging:
  # Log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  level: "INFO"
  
  # Log file path (relative to project root)
  file: "test_execution.log"
  
  # Whether to log to console as well
  console_output: true
